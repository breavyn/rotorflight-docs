### A few notes about the 20240218 snapshot

#### CRSF Reuse

EdgeTx 2.9.3 broke the CRSF sensor reuse by changing the sensor scaling.
The CRSF reuse has now been refactored for better support for different EdgeTx versions.

There are now more sensors that can be reused. The reusable sensors in the GPS frame are altitude, heading, ground speed, and satellite count.

The reuse options are now selected based on the original sensor scaling, so that the reused value can be expressed correctly.

For most reuse options, the "ratio" in EdgeTx is a variation of 255.
E.g. 25.5, 255, 2550, 25500. (including RPM!)

The voltage sensors use 20 or 200.

#### OpenYGE ESC Telemetry

There is now telemetry support for YGE ESCs (thanks Bob!). This is a brand new protocol implemented by YGE especially for Rotorflight. It will be available in the next ESC firmware update from YGE.

#### Default values in the Firmware

Many defaults have been improved. Please note that you won't get any new defaults if you load a dump all from the previous snapshot. Probably better to use a diff all, which will apply only the parameter values that are not on default values.

Next one will be a Release Candidate, so please report any issues promptly!

Happy tuning (and maybe even flying)!
