## Notes
There is a new website www.rotorflight.org for Rotorflight 2. The old Wiki in github is deprecated, and is for Rotorflight-1 only. Rotorflight 2 is NOT backward compatible with RF1. You MUST NOT load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2. If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website! As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!

### Support
The main source of Rotorflight information and instructions is now the [Website](https://www.rotorflight.org).

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - [you can join us here](https://discord.gg/6QUySXdEvd). Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there, many pro pilots and several manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/876445460825093/) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.
