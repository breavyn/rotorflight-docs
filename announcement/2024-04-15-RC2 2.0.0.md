## Notes
There is a new website www.rotorflight.org for Rotorflight 2. The old Wiki in github is deprecated, and is for Rotorflight-1 only. Rotorflight 2 is NOT backward compatible with RF1. You MUST NOT load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2. If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website! As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!

### Support
The main source of Rotorflight information and instructions is now the [Website](https://www.rotorflight.org).

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - [you can join us here](https://discord.gg/6QUySXdEvd). Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there, many pro pilots and several manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/876445460825093/) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.

To our surprise, Rotorflight is finally starting to gain momentum ðŸ˜Š

This is really great news, but it also means we need to start taking things a bit more seriously.
While preparing for the RF2 release, we have been also setting up the IT infrastructure, like
rotorflight.org domain, the website, CI, etc. This is obviously more work, but it is now
also requiring money.

If you ever wondered what to do with the money you don't need to spend on 
the commercial FBLs, we can now help with that too!

Today we are happy to announce that we are finally accepting donations!

A direct link to Paypal is here:

You can also find the Donation link in the RC2 Configurator start page.

NOW!! Who's going to be the first one? ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜† 

Thank you for your support!
