Rotorflight Official Release 2.0.0 is ready

With **massive thanks** to everyone involved in making this to happen, we are proud to announce the *first official* release of Rotorflight-2 !!!

It has been a really enjoyable two years making all this to happen! Open source development at its best.

Now we are extremely happy to offer the fruits of our hard work to the world. We believe Rotorflight-2 is already on-par with the $$$ FBLs in the market - and we are just starting our journey!

I truly hope more people can now enjoy tinkering with helicopters in an affordable way. And hopefully more people will be drawn to this hobby too, especially from the drone world.

## Notes
There is a new website www.rotorflight.org for Rotorflight 2. The old Wiki in github is deprecated, and is for Rotorflight-1 only. Rotorflight 2 is NOT backward compatible with RF1. You MUST NOT load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2. If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website! As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!

### Support
The main source of Rotorflight information and instructions is now the [Website](https://www.rotorflight.org).

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - [you can join us here](https://discord.gg/6QUySXdEvd). Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there, many pro pilots and several manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/876445460825093/) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.
