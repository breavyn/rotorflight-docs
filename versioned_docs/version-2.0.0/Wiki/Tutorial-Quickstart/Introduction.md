# Introduction 

![Introduction](./img/intro-1.jpg)

Rotorflight is a flight control software suite for single rotor RC helicopters. 

It is based on Betaflight, with many advanced features added for helicopters. 

It consists of several components:

* Rotorflight Firmware: The software that runs on your flight controller.
* The Rotorflight Configurator: Update and configure the firmware using Windows, macOS or Linux.
* Optional: Rotorflight Blackbox Explorer: Analyze Rotorflight logs on your computer.
* Optional: Rotorflight LUA scripts: Tweak your helicopter on the field using your OpenTX/EdgeTX-ETHOS transmitter.

Most Betaflight G4, F4, F7 and H7 flight controllers are compatible with Rotorflight, but they usually require some soldering. 

Since 2023 there are also [Commercial Rotorflight controllers](./What-Board.md#such-as) available.

Those dedicated Rotorflight controllers resemble traditional FBL units and don't require any soldering.

:::note
Rotorflight does NOT support multi-rotor drones, nor airplanes.

It is only for traditional RC helicopters.
